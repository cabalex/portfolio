                    <p>When I enrolled for my first quarter at Santa Cruz, I was baffled by how the course enrollment experience felt. Everything takes forever to load, and it's missing crucial information about the classes I want to take. How can I tell when classes overlap, what professors are good and bad, and when classes fill up?</p>

                    <h2>A labor of love</h2>
                    <p>I thought I'd also highlight one of my more fun projects! I've been working on creating Astral Chain mods for years - it's a game I'm really passionate about. This tool is built upon months of reverse engineering work and looking into the game's files - even building upon a previous Quest Editor I made in pure JavaScript back in 2021!</p>
                    <p>A "Quest" is Astral Chain's proprietary format for running game logic. They control waves of enemies, change in-game variables, and can trigger all sorts of fun stuff. If you've played the game, Red Cases and Blue Cases are both "quests", but they're not limited to the cases you see! Even when you're not taking down a chimera or giving a child ice cream, they're constantly running in the background.</p>
                    <p>At their core, they're made up of Binary XML files - a proprietary format that <a href="https://github.com/Kerilk/bayonetta_tools/blob/master/binary_templates/Bayonetta%202%20bxm.bt" target="_blank">a few smart people</a> figured out how to extract. The Quest Editor takes this format and runs with it, abstracting it into an easy-to-use editor!</p>

They're extremely powerful, but the block-based coding library Blockly makes it easy to understand. <i>(Yes, the Task system really works like that!)</i></p>
                    <p>Tasks are complex, and they loop every game tick until stopped. I've been the only one to research how they work, and it's quite rewarding to see code I wrote work in the game. Remember, all of this data is just an XML file, and the game is very picky about what you put in it!</p>
                    <p>You can even see the <i>questionable</i> coding decisions the developers needed to make in order to work with its constraints...</p>

                    <p>While Astral Chain is an incredibly niche game (it's been out for over 5 years), I've already made a couple mods that community members have enjoyed. It was how I learned a lot of my low-level programming experience before I ever took a Computer Science class - and it's just plain fun to mess around in my favorite game!</p>
